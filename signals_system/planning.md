# Signal Processing System Improvement Plan

## System Overview

We'll redesign the signal processing system to be more modular, efficient, and maintainable. The system will handle both file-based and live signal sources with enhanced capabilities for format handling, serialization, and signal manipulation.

## Key Improvements

1. **Modular Architecture**
   - Split into multiple files with clear responsibilities
   - Improved class inheritance hierarchy
   - Better separation of concerns

2. **Enhanced Format Handling**
   - Create base format class with common functionality
   - Specialized format implementations (JSON, CSV, HDF5, etc.)
   - Pluggable format system for easy extension

3. **Partial File Processing**
   - Efficient seeking within large files
   - Processing specific time ranges without loading entire file
   - Support for timestamp-based seeking

4. **Chunked Processing**
   - Process large signals in manageable chunks
   - Memory-efficient handling of large datasets
   - Progress tracking during long operations

5. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Consistent error propagation
   - Better logging and diagnostics
   - Recovery mechanisms for common errors

## Format System Design

The format system will be a key improvement. Each format will inherit from a base class:

```python
class SignalFormat(ABC):
    """Base class for signal format handlers."""
    
    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def name(self) -> str:
        """Name of the format."""
        pass
    
    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def extensions(self) -> List[str]:
        """File extensions used by this format."""
        pass
    
    @property
    def default_extension(self) -> str:
        """Default file extension."""
        return self.extensions[0] if self.extensions else ""
    
    @abstractmethod
    def serialize(self, frame: SignalFrame) -> bytes:
        """Serialize a signal frame to bytes."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def deserialize(self, data: bytes) -> np.ndarray:
        """Deserialize bytes to a numpy array."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def deserialize_range(self, 
                         file_obj: BinaryIO, 
                         start_time: Optional[float] = None,
                         end_time: Optional[float] = None,
                         max_samples: Optional[int] = None) -> np.ndarray:
        """Deserialize a specific range from a file."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def extract_metadata(self, file_obj: BinaryIO) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Extract metadata from a file."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_file_structure(self, file_obj: BinaryIO) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Get structure information about the file."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def write_chunk(self, 
                   file_obj: BinaryIO, 
                   chunk: np.ndarray,
                   metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> int:
        """Write a chunk of data to a file. Returns bytes written."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def finalize_file(self, file_obj: BinaryIO) -> None:
        """Finalize a file after all chunks are written."""
        pass
```

Each format implementation will provide specific functionality while maintaining a consistent interface.

## Chunked Processing Approach

For handling large files efficiently, we'll implement a chunked processing approach:

1. **Reading**:
   - Define chunk size (in samples or time duration)
   - Read file metadata first to understand structure
   - Process one chunk at a time with minimal memory footprint
   - Support parallel processing of chunks when appropriate

2. **Writing**:
   - Define chunk size for writing
   - Write metadata header first (with placeholder for total size if needed)
   - Append chunks as they become available
   - Update file metadata when complete

3. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Expose progress information during chunk processing
   - Support callbacks for progress updates
   - Enable operation cancellation

## Signal Provider Improvements

Signal providers will be enhanced to support:

1. **Efficient Seeking**:
   - Jump to specific timestamps in the file
   - Skip unwanted portions of the signal
   - Pre-calculate index mappings for large files

2. **Adaptive Buffering**:
   - Adjust buffer sizes based on signal characteristics
   - Prefetch data in background threads
   - Optimize memory usage for different file sizes

3. **Resource Management**:
   - Better handling of file handles and connections
   - Automatic cleanup with context managers
   - Thread-safe resource sharing

## Signal Format Registry

We'll implement a format registry system to:

1. Automatically discover and register available formats
2. Select appropriate format based on file extension
3. Allow users to register custom formats
4. Provide fallback mechanisms when format detection fails

## Error Handling Strategy

A consistent error handling approach will include:

1. **Custom Exception Hierarchy**:
   - `SignalProcessingError` as base exception
   - Specialized exceptions for different error types
   - Context-rich error messages

2. **Recovery Mechanisms**:
   - Retry policies for temporary failures
   - Graceful degradation when optimal processing isn't possible
   - Safe fallback options

3. **Diagnostics**:
   - Detailed logging with appropriate levels
   - Performance metrics collection
   - System state snapshots for debugging

## Implementation Priorities

1. First phase: Create the base format system and core infrastructure
2. Second phase: Implement the most common formats (JSON, CSV, NumPy)
3. Third phase: Build the chunked processing system
4. Fourth phase: Add advanced formats (HDF5, Protobuf)
5. Fifth phase: Implement efficient seeking and partial processing
6. Final phase: Add optimizations and performance improvements

## Compatibility Considerations

To ensure backward compatibility with existing code:

1. Provide adapter classes for the old API
2. Support legacy format configurations
3. Include migration utilities for existing data files
4. Document upgrade paths for different use cases

## Testing Strategy

We'll implement a comprehensive testing strategy:

1. Unit tests for each format implementation
2. Integration tests for the complete processing pipeline
3. Performance tests for large file handling
4. Edge case tests for error conditions and recovery

## Future Extensibility

The system will be designed for future extensibility:

1. Plugin system for custom formats
2. Extension points for signal processing algorithms
3. Hooks for integration with visualization tools
4. Support for distributed processing of very large signals
