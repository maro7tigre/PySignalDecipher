# Signal Processing System Design

## System Overview

We'll create a modular Python system for signal processing with these key capabilities:
- Loading signals from static files and live feeds
- Configurable time ranges (start/end times), durations
- Full-signal requests and real-time streams
- Built-in serialization/deserialization
- Configurable signal averaging
- Signal manipulation with change detection

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Signal Providers**
   - `FileSignalProvider`: Reads from pre-recorded files with timestamp/index slicing
   - `LiveSignalProvider`: Connects to streaming sources with configurable frame rates

2. **Data Serialization**
   - `Serializer`: Encodes in chosen format (JSON, Protocol Buffers, HDF5)
   - `Deserializer`: Decodes payloads into arrays or time-series objects

3. **Averaging Engine**
   - Processes signals with windowed or rolling averages
   - Configurable interval/sample count
   - Handles edge cases (incomplete windows, streaming warm-up)

4. **Signal Processor**
   - Implements filters, transforms, and custom operations
   - Monitors data and detects when manipulated signals cross thresholds
   - Triggers change events for UI updates

5. **Event Dispatcher**
   - Implements observer pattern for registering callbacks
   - Fires events for new frames, average updates, signal manipulation

6. **Configuration Manager**
   - Handles parameters (time ranges, frame rates, averaging windows, etc.)
   - Provides CLI/API interface for settings

7. **Visualization Layer**
   - Displays signals in real-time
   - Updates based on event notifications

## Data Flow

1. **Initialization**
   - Load configuration parameters
   - Set up appropriate SignalProvider based on mode (file/live)
   - Configure averaging and serialization

2. **Data Ingestion**
   - File mode: Read blocks from file with specified start/end times
   - Live mode: Subscribe to streaming source at configured frame rate
   - Deserialize incoming data to internal format

3. **Processing Pipeline**
   - Raw signal → Averaging Engine → Signal Processor
   - Track state for change detection

4. **Event Handling**
   - Dispatch events when:
     - New frames arrive (live mode)
     - Averaging window completes
     - Signal changes exceed thresholds after manipulation

5. **Visualization**
   - Update display based on processed signal data
   - Apply configurable refresh rates to balance performance

## Configuration Parameters

### General Settings
- `mode`: `file` or `live`
- `start_time`: Beginning timestamp for processing
- `end_time`: Ending timestamp for processing
- `duration`: Alternative to end_time (start_time + duration)
- `full_signal`: Boolean to request entire signal

### Live Mode Settings
- `frame_rate`: Frequency of updates (Hz)
- `buffer_size`: Memory allocation for streaming data
- `connection_params`: Socket/API configuration

### Averaging Settings
- `window_size`: Time or sample count for averaging
- `window_type`: "rolling", "fixed", "exponential"
- `overlap`: For overlapping windows

### Serialization Settings
- `format`: "json", "protobuf", "hdf5"
- `compression`: "none", "gzip", "lzma"

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Create abstract `SignalProvider` base class
2. Implement `FileSignalProvider` with time slicing
3. Develop serialization/deserialization components
4. Build basic averaging engine

### Phase 2: Live Processing
1. Implement `LiveSignalProvider` with connection handling
2. Add buffer management and frame rate control
3. Create event dispatch system
4. Implement async processing queue

### Phase 3: Signal Processing
1. Add signal manipulation capabilities
2. Implement change detection algorithms
3. Create callback registration system
4. Optimize performance for real-time processing

### Phase 4: User Interface
1. Develop configuration interface
2. Create visualization components
3. Add user controls for parameter adjustment
4. Implement progress tracking and status display

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- Use NumPy for efficient array operations
- Implement thread pooling for parallel processing
- Consider using Cython for performance-critical sections
- Optimize memory usage with buffer recycling

### Thread Safety
- Use thread-safe queues for data passing
- Implement locks for shared resources
- Consider using asyncio for I/O operations

### Error Handling
- Implement graceful recovery for connection issues
- Add data validation and error reporting
- Create comprehensive logging system

## Next Steps
- Define detailed class interfaces
- Select specific libraries for serialization (consider msgpack, protobuf)
- Choose visualization framework (matplotlib, pyqtgraph)
- Create project structure and development environment
