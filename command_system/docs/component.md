## Component Interactions

### How Observable Hierarchy and Generations Work

1. Each `Observable` object can have a parent, tracked via `parent_id`
2. When an `Observable` is created with a parent, it inherits the parent's generation + 1
3. The generation counter helps track object ancestry and can optimize refreshes
4. During serialization, both `parent_id` and `generation` are saved
5. When deserializing, the parent-child relationships are reconstructed

### How Commands and Observables Interact

1. When an `ObservableProperty` changes, it notifies all registered observers
2. Command-aware widgets observe these changes and update their display
3. When users modify a widget, it creates a `PropertyCommand`
4. The `PropertyCommand` changes the observable property, completing the cycle

### How UI Widgets and Commands Interact

1. UI widgets extend both Qt widgets and `CommandWidgetBase`
2. When bound to a model, they observe property changes
3. When users modify them, they create and execute commands
4. Commands update the model, triggering property change notifications

### How Dock Management Integrates

1. The `DockManager` maintains a registry of dock widgets and their states
2. Dock operations (create, delete, move) are encapsulated as commands
3. `CommandDockWidget` captures user interactions and creates appropriate commands
4. `ObservableDockWidget` binds an observable model to a dock widget
5. Dock states are serialized and included in layout data

### How Layout Management Works

1. The `LayoutManager` registers widgets to track in layouts
2. When saving a layout, it captures the state of all registered widgets
3. Special handling is applied for different widget types (splitters, tabs, docks)
4. Qt-specific types like `DockWidgetArea` are serialized using `LayoutEncoder`
5. When restoring a layout, widgets are placed in their saved positions
6. Widget factories are used to recreate widgets that don't exist yet

### How Project Serialization Connects Everything

1. `ProjectManager` coordinates model serialization and layout saving
2. `ObservableEncoder` serializes observable models, their properties, and hierarchy information
3. `ProjectSerializer` handles different file formats and storage
4. When saving layouts with projects, layout data is appended to the project file
5. When loading, the model is reconstructed first, then layout is applied
6. `observable_decoder` dynamically imports and creates model classes
7. After loading, command history is cleared to start fresh

## Data Flow During Key Operations

### Save Operation Flow

```
User → UI → ProjectManager.save_project()
  ↓
ProjectSerializer.save_to_file() → ObservableEncoder → File (model data + hierarchy)
  ↓
save_layout_with_project() → LayoutManager.capture_current_layout()
  ↓
LayoutManager → DockManager → Widget states → File (layout data)
```

### Load Operation Flow

```
User → UI → ProjectManager.load_project()
  ↓
ProjectSerializer.load_from_file() → observable_decoder → Model reconstruction with hierarchy
  ↓
load_layout_from_project() → LayoutManager.apply_layout()
  ↓
LayoutManager → DockManager → Widget state restoration → UI update
```

### Property Change Flow

```
Model.property = new_value → ObservableProperty.__set__()
  ↓
model._notify_property_changed() → Observer callbacks
  ↓
CommandWidget._on_property_changed() → Widget update
```

### Widget Change Flow

```
User → Widget interaction → CommandWidget._on_widget_value_changed()
  ↓
CommandWidget._create_property_command() → CommandManager.execute()
  ↓
PropertyCommand.execute() → Model.property = new_value → ObservableProperty.__set__()
  ↓
model._notify_property_changed() → Other observers updated
```

## File Storage Structure

When a project is saved with layout data, the file structure is:

```
[Model data in selected format (JSON, binary, etc.)]
__LAYOUT_DATA_BEGIN__
[Layout data in JSON format]
__LAYOUT_DATA_END__
```

The layout data is always in JSON format regardless of the model data format. This allows the layout to be loaded even if the model format changes.

## Benefits of the Integrated Approach

The tight integration between these components provides several benefits:

1. **Consistent Undo/Redo**: All changes, whether from direct API calls or UI interactions, are tracked in the same history
2. **Automatic UI Updates**: When model properties change, UI widgets automatically update
3. **Hierarchical Modeling**: Parent-child relationships and generations facilitate complex model structures
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component focuses on a specific responsibility
5. **Extensibility**: New commands, widgets, or serialization formats can be added without changing existing code
6. **Persistence**: Application state, including UI layout, can be saved and restored
7. **Type Safety**: ObservableProperty uses generics for type checking

## Extension Points

The system is designed to be extended in various ways:

1. **Custom Commands**: Create new command types for domain-specific operations
2. **Observable Models**: Define models with observable properties for your application
3. **Custom Widgets**: Create new command-aware widgets for specialized UI elements
4. **Layout Extensions**: Add support for custom widget state serialization
5. **Serialization Formats**: Implement support for additional formats
6. **Integration Points**: Connect with other frameworks or libraries
7. **Hierarchy Tracking**: Implement custom operations based on object generations

## Component Initialization Order

When setting up an application, components should be initialized in this order:

1. Create `CommandManager` (or get the singleton instance)
2. Create `ProjectManager` (or get the singleton instance)
3. Extend project manager with layout capabilities (`extend_project_manager()`)
4. Get `LayoutManager` and `DockManager` instances
5. Set main window references for both managers
6. Begin initialization mode (`cmd_manager.begin_init()`)
7. Create model instances with appropriate parent/child relationships
8. Create UI components and bind to models
9. Register widgets with layout manager
10. End initialization mode (`cmd_manager.end_init()`)

Following this order ensures that all components are properly connected and that initialization operations don't pollute the command history.
