# TODO: Replace layout serialization/deserialization system
#
# This file implemented:
# 1. LayoutEncoder - JSON encoder for QT-specific types (DockWidgetArea, Orientation)
# 2. layout_decoder - JSON decoder for QT-specific types
# 3. serialize_layout/deserialize_layout - Functions for layout data conversion
#
# Expected inputs:
#   - Dictionary of layout data containing QT-specific types
#   - JSON strings containing serialized layout data
#
# Expected outputs:
#   - JSON strings with QT types converted to serializable format
#   - Dictionary of layout data with proper QT objects reconstructed
#
# Called from:
#   - LayoutManager.save_layout_preset()
#   - LayoutManager.load_layout_preset()
#   - save_layout_with_project()/load_layout_from_project()
#
# The system handled QT-specific types like:
#   - Qt.DockWidgetArea (Left, Right, Top, Bottom, All, None)
#   - Qt.Orientation (Horizontal, Vertical)

    # TODO: Replace layout serialization method

    # This method was responsible for:
    # 1. Saving current state of all docks
    # 2. Creating a serializable structure with dock states
    #
    # Expected inputs:
    #   - None (uses internal dock state)
    #
    # Expected outputs:
    #   - Dictionary with dock layout states
    #
    # Called from:
    #   - save_layout_with_project()
    #   - SaveLayoutCommand.execute()
    #
    # Format included:
    #   - State (position, size, visibility, floating state, etc.)
    #   - Parent-child relationships

    # This method was responsible for:
    # 1. Updating internal dock states from serialized data
    # 2. Restoring dock states in dependency order (parents first)
    #
    # Expected inputs:
    #   - Dictionary with serialized layout data
    #
    # Expected outputs:
    #   - Boolean indicating success

    #   - load_layout_from_project()
